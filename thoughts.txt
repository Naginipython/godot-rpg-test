cutscenes:
	Standard character movement (speed: MOVE_DISTANCE 16.0 / duration 0.2)*delta idk math
	Character expressions - (!) (?), etc
	Dialogue. Ending dialogue continues animation
	Walking infinite + dialogue, stops infinite once dialogue ends
	

Issues:
	How to animate chars? Animation player?
	Dialogue pauses ani_player? After ending (current), continues animation, then new dialogue?
	How do I store dialogue?

How to apply stat to choice:
action choice -> profile choice -> apply buff to profile
action_action -> player_menu  ->  Choice (Combat)  ->  Main (combat)
choice -> adds to tempStat array -> exit applies to Combat -> log

Combat:
action_attack -> player_menu -> Main (Combat)
choice -> use/log -> changes hp state state

action_action -> player_menu -> Main (Combat)
choice -> 

action_item -> player_menu -> Main (Combat) -> GameManager
choice -> quant/use/log -> turn/hp -> eventually, record item quantity
