cutscenes:
	Standard character movement (speed: MOVE_DISTANCE 16.0 / duration 0.2)*delta idk math
	Character expressions - (!) (?), etc
	Dialogue. Ending dialogue continues animation
	Walking infinite + dialogue, stops infinite once dialogue ends
	

Issues:
	How to animate chars? Animation player?
	Dialogue pauses ani_player? After ending (current), continues animation, then new dialogue?
	How do I store dialogue?
