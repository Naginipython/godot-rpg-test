cutscenes:
	Standard character movement (speed: MOVE_DISTANCE 16.0 / duration 0.2)*delta idk math
	Character expressions - (!) (?), etc
	Dialogue. Ending dialogue continues animation
	Walking infinite + dialogue, stops infinite once dialogue ends
	

Issues:
	How to animate chars? Animation player?
	Dialogue pauses ani_player? After ending (current), continues animation, then new dialogue?
	How do I store dialogue?


Cool Gameplay Ideas:
Attacks deal damage & sometimes add buffs
Actions add buffs/debuffs/heals, and provide opportunity to spare
buffs/debuff effect str, def, spd, acc, evad
collabs are still ???

possible attack_game buffs/debuffs: more/less special attacks, faster/slower (per lane?), build 
	more/less collab, 

Type change would be wild (Sinon going from Seiso -> Yabai etc)

AI suggestions:
	Type system ideas: Seiso, Yabai, Pon(katsu) (rock-paper-scissors). Yabai > Seiso > Pon
	Possible alt: Idol, Gamer, Comedian. Gamer > Idol > Comedian
	game speed: "Hype" stat. Hype up makes meter build faster & u deal more dmg, Chill Out opposite
	Attack_game notes: "lag" makes it freeze & then hit the zone. "Spam" can hide the board
	stats: spd widens perfect window, evad make a hit possibly "ghosted"
	actions cost "super chats", basically mana

Bedtime thoughts:
	Need to worry about branching dialogue
	Action type or whatever should be array bc it can buff 2 stats
	What about actions that change type?
	Each enemy has special actions to spare, but each one requires a certain type available 
		(aggressive enemies have seiso spare actions, then maybe yab idk) 
		(this can be a different data set with IDs for char)
	Battle dialogue used once per battle in array of that resource (easy compare)
		Used line recycling bin array via reference checking
