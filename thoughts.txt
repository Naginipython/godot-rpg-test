dialogue system:
	hard code npc text? 
	keep a state of what dialogue scene i am in. 
		0 is great library cutscene, clio starts with state 0 dialogue, of helpful thoughts
		1 is once you've left the library, on your way to the Jelly Kingdom. Clio at 1 will ask why you're back so early
	What is a special character?
		All Phase Connect members
		Fan creature enemies
	A special character will consist of:
		everything in character data
		portrait atlus
		name & title
		dict of:
			state or -1:
				dict{text, face}
	NPC will consist of:
		text

NPC WILL JUST HAVE TEXT
SPECIAL WILL EITHER BE FROM CHAR_DATA OR SPECIAL NPC
currently: 
	npc has collider that triggers entered in player, adding all npcs to an array npcs_in_range
	when you press 'e', checks if npc_in_range and facing one, then changes state to talking
	talking state: enables textbox text
	textbox: takes an npc and adds text to queue and runs it

-currently, if its a normal npc, it takes that NPC and sets default, takes its text then 
displays the first
-If a special npc is found, it extracts its textbox settings from SpecialNpc, then takes its
face/text details
-How can I make a character use a textbox?
Option 1: Make SpecialNPC a char_data
	pros: easy stats & TextUI for Enemy & Players
	cons: dialogue between different same npcs
